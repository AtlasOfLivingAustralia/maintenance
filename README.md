# maintenance
Container for possible future maintenance issues, and the Maintenance Zenhub board.

This is NOT a place for specific issues for specific projects: create project-specific issues in the appropriate repository.

This repo can be used as a dumping ground for possible future tasks (to be broken down into specific issues at a later date), but is primarily intended as a container for the Zenhub board (which pulls in issues from multiple repositories).
